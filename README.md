This is will be my first project for both Playwright and Pytest

Tests should be runnable just by calling pytest from project's root

Wanted to try out async approach - it's probably more difficult, but I'm used to handling async. Was running into issues and after further research reading that async doesn't add too much of a value I decided to scratch it and go "easy way".

Threading is another thing I wanted to explore, but underestimated how much time the project took so that's cancelled as well. But I will revisit this in the future, because I wonder how it's handled, what are the benefits etc.

We are running headed chromium by default, but it can be easily changed.

Project is small, so my solutions might be overthought a bit, but I was focusing on designing solution just like I would for a real project.
